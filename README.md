## Test

I have added a console.log for where data is sent over to the database. You can open the appliation in your web browser. After doing so right the screen and click inspect and then to go the Application tab. Press Offline under Service Worker to bring the application offline. Input data into the graph after inputing data into the graph, refresh your indexDB to see if the data saved. If it did bring the application back online and go to node console to see if the data is being sent to your database.
